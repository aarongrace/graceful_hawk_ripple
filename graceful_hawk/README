# Hawk

The Hawk emulator is an emulator for a 32-bit RISC machine written in C
designed to run under Linux.  It has been in use since 1996 as a tool
for teaching introductory computer organization and assembly language
programming.

## Installation

Use `make compiler=cc` from the command line.  This will read `Makefile`
and produce an executable named `hawk`.  You can set compler options here,
for example, use `make 'compiler=cc -O'` to make the compiler generate
more optimal code.

Variables set in the makefile itself allow you to set the amount of RAM
and ROM on your emulated machine, and they allow you to select between
a full configuration of the Hawk emulator and the Sparrowhawk subset.

For more detail, see `Makefile`.  Note:  The Hawk emulator uses the
`curses` library.  If this is not installed on your system, you will need
to get it before using Make.

## Use

From the command line, type `hawk testfile` to launch the Hawk emulator
with `testfile` loaded in memory (RAM, ROM or both).  The emulator always
starts in halt state with the program counter set to zero.

The test file supplied with this distribution contains the scrambled fragments
of a limerick.  When run, the program sorts the fragments into order and
outputs the resulting limerick.  To produce additional object files, you
will need to use the SMAL assembler.

Multiple object files may be specified on the command line; all of them
will be loaded in the order specified.  If any of the files load the same
memory location, they will overlay each other, leftmost file first.

The object code format expected is that produced by the SMAL assembler
or linker.

Once the loading is complete, the emulator will display the CPU state in the
top of the terminal window, leaving the bottom mapped to the emulator's
video RAM.  The terminal window may not be resized after the emulator is
launched.

When halted, the emulator responds to single letter commands.  These are
described in a brief one-line help message.  The commands are:

* **`r`** -- run until _pc_ = _0_ or until _pc_ = _break_
* **`s`** -- single step (follows branches and calls)
* **`n`** -- set _break_ to next instruction, run (e.g. until subroutine return)
* **`q`** -- quit
* **hexadecimal digits** -- shifted into _n_, a command parameter
* **`m`** -- show memory around address _n_
* **`+`** -- scroll the memory display to increasing addresses
* **`-`** -- scroll the memory display to decreasing addresses
* **`t`** -- toggle the memory display between hexadecimal and disassembly
* **`p`** -- set _break_ = _n_ and run
* **`>`** -- increment _break_
* **`<`** -- decrement _break_
* **`i`** -- set _break_ = _pc_ and run (typically one loop iteration)
* **`z`** -- set _refresh_ = _n_ (memory cycles between display updates)
